This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an async function inside.  The problem is that the async function doesn't return a promise, making it difficult for the cleanup function to know when to execute.  This could lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior. Consider the following example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const json = await response.json();
    setData(json);
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

In this case, `fetchData` doesn't return anything, so there is no way to abort the network request in the cleanup function. This is a common mistake causing issues when the component unmounts while the request is still ongoing.
